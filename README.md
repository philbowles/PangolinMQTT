# Features

 * Full* MQTT v3.1.1 Qos0/1/2 compliance, session management and recovery
 * Payload size limited only by available heap (~20kB on ESP8266, ~120kb on ESP32)
 * TLS support (ESP8266 only)
 * Compile-time multilevel diagnostic
 * Utility functions to view binary payloads and handle as:
   * C-style string (`char*`)
   * `std::string`
   * Arduino `String`
   * < any arithmetic type >
 * Full error-handling including:
   * QoS failures*
   * Subscribe failure
   * "Killer" packets ( > free available heap) both inbound and outbound

**NB** *No device can *fully* comply with MQTT 3.1.1 QoS unless it has unlimited permanent storage to hold failed QoS messages across reboots. For more in-depth explanation of the reasons, read [Challenges of MQTT QoS on embedded systems](docs/qos.md)

# Performance

# Features you may not find in other libraries:

## Large Payloads

PangolinMQTT automatically fragments outbound packets and reassembles inbound packets of any size up to about 1/2 the free heap. User code simply gets a copy of the full packet - irrespective of its size - without any fuss and requiring *zero* code on the user's part.

## Full QoS1 / QoS2 compatibility / recovery

PangolinMQTT's author is unaware of any similar libraries for ESP8266/ESP32 that *fully* and *correctly* implement QoS1/2 *in all circumstances*.

They *may* sometimes work, e.g. with only small packets and/or slow send rates but fail when either increases. None will correctly recover "lost" messages on unexpected disconnect. Given that this is pretty much the *only* purpose of QoS1/2 then any library *not* fulfilling this promise *cannot* legitimately claim to be QoS1/2 compatible. If a library does not do this:

![mqtt spec](assets/pv2mqtt.jpg)

Then it ***does not support QoS1/2*** no matter what claims it may make.

# The "menagerie" roadmap

PangolinMQTT is one of a family of firmware packages for simple *robust* and rapid ***asynchronous*** IOT development on ESP8266 / ESP32

# Issues / Support

Your **first** point of contact should be one of the facebook groups below, if only to let me know you have raised an issue here. Obviously I will check the issues from time to time, but I do no have the time to check every day.

If you want a rapid response, I am daily moderating those FB groups, including a new one especially set up for Pangolin users:

## Before submitting an issue

If you do not provide sufficient information for me to be able to replicate the problem, ***I CANNOT FIX IT***

So, always provide: the MCU/board type, a good description of the problem, how / when / why it happens and how to recreate it, as well as the full source code, relevant Serial output messages and a DECODED stack trace in the event of a crash.

---

## And finally...

This is open-source, I do it in my own time, for free. If you want professional-level support because you are using *my* work to benefit your own commercial gain, then I'm happy to talk privately about a paid support contract. Or you can support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/esparto)
