# The API "issues" with AsyncMqttClient

The Pangolin API mirrors - as closely as possible - the existing API of `AsyncMqttClient` to enable users to migrate code quickly. However the `AsyncMqttClient` API has simple errors, redundant and flawed functions. For that reason some small changes have necessarily been made just to be able to compile *correctly* coded examples.

It also omits some necessary functionality which Pangolin has added. New users must be warned: what you see at this version of Pangolin is not good, fully functional nor error-free, it exists as it is for a very specific purpose, and *will* change a fair degree at the next release to correct all the issues described here problems.

The starting point then is to look first at the AsyncMqttClient API documentation

## Absolute essentials - do NOT skip this section!

### Necessary defintions / clarification

Many of the functions are simply *wrong* and *appear* to have been written with the misundertanding that MQTT payloads are "strings". They are not. The discussion of what is a "string" gets even experienced programmers heated: this is not "C programming for beginners". You should know the difference between a `char*` and `byte*` or `uint8_t` already.

** MQTT payloads are NOT "strings" of any form or description and CANNOT be treated as such without serious problems and potential crashes **

### MQTT payloads

**ALL** MQTT payloads are length-described blocks of arbitrary bytes aka "BLOB" (*B*inary *L*arge *OB*jects). They don't have to be large - mostly they contain only a few charactaers of temperature or some other sensor reading etc, but the term is a good one because it describes *ALL* payloads including the tiny ones.

The correct C/C++ datatype for such data is either `byte` or `uint8_t`. It is *NOT*, never has been and never will be `char`.

Therefore, any reference to payload data that is *not* a `uint8_t` or a `uint8_t*` pointer to that data is also *WRONG*. The biggest problem in assuming tht "its the same as a `char*`" is that 99% of C string functions use `char*` for the simple fact they operate on C-strings and MQTT payloads ***are NOT strings***.

Seeing a `char*` then can easliy seduce the programmer into thinking what it points to is a string as 99.9% of the times he has seen it before, it *does*. Thus "Oh, char* - must be a string then, I'll pass it to `strlen` or `strcpy` or `strXXXanything` else" - but if you do any of those things with an MQTT payload, your code will probably crash, because ***it is NOT a string***. 

That fact alone should be enough to remind you to *always* address payload data with a `uint8_t*` - if it isn't, you are going to have problems.

The [MQTT specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html) has little more to say on the payload than this:

```
3.3.3 Payload 
The Payload contains the Application Message that is being published. The content and format of the data is application specific
```

Think about "*application specific*": it means *any* app can put *anything* it wants in there... so why do some people assume it's a string? It's *not*, it's whatever the application that sent it chose to put in there. That's why it has no structure or type - that is up to *you*. It's just a "BLOB" of bytes whose correct C / C++ type is `uint8_t[]`. It is up to *your code* to check / validate / confirm that the contents are as expected. Failure to do so, or a faulty assumption about its contents will almost certaily lead to corrupt data at best and at worst, a crash.

## General points

### "Packet Id"s

Packet Ids are generated by a client and a server as a necessary part of the MQTT protocol "handshake" process. Client and server each have different sequences and they have no meaning whatsoever to the user.

As such, there is nothing safe, useful or informative any user can do with one. Debating their presence in the `AsyncMqttClient` API only raises more questions than it can answer: All references to them in the API will be removed at next release. 


## Specific Problems / Fixes

* new getMaxPayloadSize

Required to prevent attemps to send payload bigger than the lib can handle. `AsyncMqttClient` has no way of telling you what that figure is, and will just refuse or crash if you try. This is also the maximun value of any inbound packets. Any attempt in either direction will call the new `onError` callback with info on the size of the offending packet.

* new onError callbacxk

Provides much-needed handling of abnormal conditions simply ignored by `AsyncMqttClient`. The prototype is:

```cpp
void onError(uint8_t code,int info);
```

Where code is one of the following:
```cpp
enum PANGO_FAILURE : uint8_t {
    SUBSCRIBE_FAIL,
    INBOUND_QOS_FAIL,
    OUTBOUND_QOS_FAIL,
    INBOUND_QOS_ACK_FAIL,
    OUTBOUND_QOS_ACK_FAIL,
    INBOUND_PUB_TOO_BIG,
    OUTBOUND_PUB_TOO_BIG,
    BOGUS_PACKET,
    BOGUS_ACK
};
```

`info` has a different meaning depending on the error. 

* onMessage
  
To resolve the issues outlined above, the `payload` parameter has already been changed to the correct type `uint8_t*`: you may need to change your existing code.

There is no reason why the `qos`, `dup` and `retain` values should be inside a struct, let alone one with a 33-character name of `AsyncMqttClientMessageProperties` The name has been shortened for now to PANGO_PROPS and will be removed completely at the next release with those inner fields having their own distinct existence

`AsyncMqttClient` does not reassemble large inbound packets, it expects *you* to do all the hard work which is non-trivial. It is also a major source of bugs and part of the reason QoS1 & 2 do not work properly on `AsyncMqttClient` . [Read more](bugs.md)

Pangolin automatically ressembles any packet that will safely fit into memory and delivers you the whole packet *once* with the correct size. If it gets a "killer packet", it ignores all the fragments for you and then calls the new `onError` function to tell you the size of the bullet you just dodged.

For this reason, `index` and `total` are redundant

The next version is likely to look like:
```cpp
void onMessage(const char* topic, uint8_t* payload, size_t length,uint8_t qos, bool dup, bool retain);
```

* onPublish, onSubscribe, unSubscribe callbacks

Have no practical purpose or function. See the notes above on packet Ids.

Obviously the functions that set these callbacks are now even *more* pointless. All 6 removed at next release withiout any loss of functionality to the library.

* publish

Perhaps equal first place with `subscribe` as the most use / important function in the API, so it's worrying that it contains errors and misinformation

Firstly, there is the necessary change to the *correct* `uint8_t` type for the payload which will require a change to existing code.

`qos`, `retain` and `dup`: Why are not the members of 33-character `struct` `AsyncMqttClientMessageProperties` required to be in one here? For the same reason already outlined above: Because there is no reason for them to be in one at all.

Now let's consider `dup`

The [MQTT specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html) has this to say about `dup`:

```
3.3.1.1 DUP
...
If the DUP flag is set to 0, it indicates that this is the first occasion that the Client or Server has attempted to send this MQTT PUBLISH Packet. If the DUP flag is set to 1, it indicates that this might be re-delivery of an earlier attempt to send the Packet. The DUP flag MUST be set to 1 by the Client or Server when it attempts to re-deliver a PUBLISH Packet [MQTT-3.3.1.-1]. The DUP flag MUST be set to 0 for all QoS 0 messages [MQTT-3.3.1-2].
```

Is the user in control of any of that, or is it what he/she expects the library to be doing for hime/her?

```
The DUP flag in the outgoing PUBLISH packet is set independently to the incoming PUBLISH packet, its value MUST be determined solely by whether the outgoing PUBLISH packet is a retransmission [MQTT-3.3.1-3].
```

Note the use of "*solely*" - i.e only by something thing that can know when it is necessary: the library itself. Allowing the user to *set* it can only be described as pointless and potentially dangerous.

Not only is there *no* circumstance under which you should ever touch it, you *absolutely should never be allowed to*. If you even *think* of touching it, you would break QoS1. If QoS1 worked, that is.

 New overloads to `publish` are added that make it easy to supply a payload of std::string or Arduino String without having to worry about calculating its length

* `setWill` 

Firstly it has a payload, so everything you have already learned about those also applies. It has already hd the incorrect `char*` changed to `uint8_t*` so - again - your existing code may need to change.

It also has a fatal bug. See [Bugs](bugs.md#setwill)

* onDisconnect 

Has the same pointlessly-long-name issue: `AsyncMqttClientDisconnectReason` albeit only 30 chracters this time.
It describes amd renames what its just a `uint8_t` which is wrong anyway because to get the *fullest* information from the many *valid* disconnect reasons, it needs to be a *signed* `int8_t`.

LwIP produces [error codes](https://www.nongnu.org/lwip/2_0_x/group__infrastructure__errors.html) with negative value and these get fed back up through ESPAsyncTCP eventually to this library, which also has a few of its own valid reasons. How to tell the difference? All of Pangolin's are +ve of course, but now if you get a rare underlying TCP error which will help in diagnosing problems, you will at least get told the reason, unlike `AsyncMqttClient` which just either ignores it, lets its escalate to a confusingly different error or simply pretends it didn't happen.

The positive, library generated disconnect reasons are taken from:

```cpp
  TCP_DISCONNECTED = 0,
//  MQTT_UNACCEPTABLE_PROTOCOL_VERSION = 1,
  MQTT_IDENTIFIER_REJECTED = 2,
  MQTT_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE = 3,
  MQTT_MALFORMED_CREDENTIALS = 4,
  MQTT_NOT_AUTHORIZED = 5,
//  ESP8266_NOT_ENOUGH_SPACE = 6,
  TLS_BAD_FINGERPRINT = 7,
  TCP_TIMEOUT,
};

```

## New utility functions in the PANGO:: namespace

`AsyncMqttClient` is totally lacking in any funtionality to unpack or otherwise handle an incoming payload, which we *now* know is always just a BLOB. Pangoline remedies this by providing a few nifty functions that will save you a lot of time.

They all live in the `PANGO` namespace  which means to call them you need to write e.g. 
```cpp
PANGO::dumphex(payload,length);
```
 Which will display something like this to allow you to see the exact contents of the BLOB.

```
dumphex exaaaaaample
```

 In the real world when you subscribe to a topic, you generally know what is the format of the data it contains. Usually that is because *you* have decided it! That fact alone however does not stop:

 * People like me loading up any old MQTT client app e.g. MQTT-spy and throwing a huge packet of random junk at you under the topic that *should* have your cat's heartbeat per minute in it as a c-style string of less than 4 digits. 

* Badly written MQTT client libraries can corrupt data in-flight that was valid when someone else sent it.

The point is if *you* don't validate the packet, no-one else is going to. And if you *don't* validate it and simply assume it has in it what it *ought* to, well then you are designing-in failure. **ALWAYS VALIDATE YOUR PACKETS!**

Pangolin provides the following assistance in addition to the hex dumper already mentioned:

```cpp
char*            payloadToCstring(uint8_t* data,size_t len);
int              payloadToInt(uint8_t* data,size_t len);
std::string      payloadToStdstring(uint8_t* data,size_t len);
String           payloadToString(uint8_t* data,size_t len);

```

All of them are designed to be called with `PANGO::xxx(payload, length)` inside the `onMessage` callback, but will work anywhere in your code with any blob + known length. There are plenty of examples in the  er... [examples](examples.md).

`char* payloadToCstring(uint8_t* data,size_t len);`

Returns a `char*` that you can pass to any C string function *only if the packet actually does in fact contain a valid NUL-terminated c-string*. If it *doesn't* then all hell will break loose probably leading to an exception and a crash.

In addition you *MUST* `free` the returned pointer before exiting your function or you will cause a memory leak. **You have been warned**

Happily, none of the other functions require anything fancy like that.

`int payloadToInt(uint8_t* data,size_t len);` 

Returns an int *only if the packet actually does in fact contain a valid NUL-terminated c-string consiting of numeric digits*. If it *doesn't* then all hell etc... If it' a valid string but contains alpah characters you will get either zero some bogus value.

`std::string payloadToStdstring(uint8_t* data,size_t len);`

Does what is says on he tin *if* valid c-string etc - you know the drill by now.

`String payloadToString(uint8_t* data,size_t len);`

Same as above but returns an Arduino String (capital "S") if you re daft enoiugh to want to use one.]
