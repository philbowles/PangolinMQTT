# Bug Fixes

# New features

* TLS added (ESP8266 only) please [Read the docs](tls.md) and treat as "experimental" You ***must*** download this bug-fix [patched version of ESPAsyncTCP](REF!!!)

# Changes

## Breaking

None this time, but be warned that the [illogical and incorrect API](api.md) inherited from AsyncMqttClient *will* be fixed soon.

## Non-breaking

`options.h` file updated to compile automatically for ESP8266 / ESP32 targets and easy include/exclude of TLS

[Quickstart_P sketch](../examples/QuickStart_P/QuickStart_P.ino) updated to be ESp32 compatible
